# DSA Practice

This repository contains my **daily Data Structures & Algorithms practice** solutions.

## Purpose
- Maintain consistency using GitHub contribution heatmap
- Track progress across common DSA patterns
- Build problem-solving discipline

## What’s inside
- Solutions to DSA problems (primarily from LeetCode)
- Problems may vary in difficulty and topic
- Code is written for clarity and learning, not optimization only

## Notes
- Not all problems are solved optimally on the first attempt
- Some solutions may be revisited and improved later
- Detailed explanations and learning notes are maintained separately (Notion)

## Goal
Consistency > perfection.
